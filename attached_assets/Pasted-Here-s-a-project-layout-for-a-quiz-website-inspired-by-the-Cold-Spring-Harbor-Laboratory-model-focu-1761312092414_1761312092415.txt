Here's a project layout for a quiz website inspired by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory model, focusing on the "science and biology" behind the facts.

This layout is based on a modern, component-based web application (like one built with React, Vue, or Svelte) and prioritizes the educational "why" aspect.

### 1\. 🎯 Core Concept & Features

  * **Mission:** To educate users on women's health topics (Menopause, Endometriosis, etc.) by not just testing their knowledge, but by providing **immediate, in-depth scientific explanations** for each answer.
  * **Core Loop:**
    1.  User selects a quiz topic.
    2.  User answers a question (e.g., True/False or Multiple Choice).
    3.  User clicks "Submit."
    4.  An **"Explanation" card** appears *immediately*.
    5.  This card states if the answer was correct and then provides the "why" (the biological or scientific fact).
    6.  User clicks "Next Question."
    7.  After the last question, the user sees a final score and a summary of all the facts they learned.

### 2\. 💻 Technology Stack (Suggested)

  * **Frontend Framework:** **React** (or Vue/Svelte). A JavaScript framework is essential for managing the quiz state (current question, score, user answers) and creating the interactive components.
  * **Styling:** **CSS Modules** or **Tailwind CSS**. You need a clean, readable, and accessible layout that presents the complex information clearly.
  * **Data:** **JSON File**. For a project of this scale, you don't need a complex database. All quiz questions, answers, and explanations can be stored in a single `quizData.json` file.
  * **Deployment:** **Vercel** or **Netlify**. Both are perfect for hosting modern, static-first JavaScript applications.

### 3\. 🗂️ Project Directory Structure

Here’s a typical file structure for a React-based project:

```
/quiz-website
│
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── index.html
│
├── src/
│   │
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── images/ (e.g., biology-diagrams, topic-icons.png)
│   │   └── styles/ (e.g., main.css)
│   │
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Quiz.jsx           # Main component that manages quiz logic
│   │   ├── Question.jsx       # Displays the question text and options
│   │   ├── AnswerOption.jsx   # A single clickable answer button
│   │   ├── Explanation.jsx    # *** The MOST important component ***
│   │   │                      # Shows "Correct/Incorrect" and the "why"
│   │   ├── ScoreScreen.jsx    # Displays the final score and summary

└── package.json
```

### 4\. 📄 Data Structure (The "Why" Model)

This is the most critical part. Your `quizData.json` needs to be structured to support the "why."

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "id": "menopause",
      "title": "The Biology of Menopause",
      "icon": "path/to/menopause-icon.png",
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "questionText": "True or False: Hot flashes are a psychological symptom, not a biological one.",
          "options": ["True", "False"],
          "correctAnswer": 1, // Index of "False"
          "explanation": {
            "title": "Fact: It's Biological!",
            "text": "Hot flashes are a direct biological response. They are caused by the body's 'thermostat' (the hypothalamus in the brain) becoming more sensitive to slight changes in body temperature. This happens because of declining **estrogen** levels, which help regulate the hypothalamus. The brain mistakenly thinks the body is overheating and triggers a 'flash' to cool it down."
          }
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "questionText": "What is the primary biological reason for increased osteoporosis risk after menopause?",
          "options": [
            "Decreased calcium intake",
            "A drop in the hormone estrogen",
            "A less active lifestyle",
            "Natural aging of bones"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": {
            "title": "The Science: Estrogen & Bone Density",
            "text": "While all options can contribute, the primary driver is **estrogen**. Estrogen plays a crucial role in regulating bone turnover (the process of breaking down old bone and building new bone). Specifically, it restrains the cells that break down bone (osteoclasts). When estrogen levels drop during menopause, these cells become more active, leading to faster bone loss."
          }
        }
        // ... more questions
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "endometriosis",
      "title": "Understanding Endometriosis",
      "icon": "path/to/endo-icon.png",
      "questions": [
        // ... more questions structured the same way
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5\. 🌊 User Flow (Page by Page)

1.  **Page 1: Home (Route: `/`)**

      * **Component:** `<Home />`
      * **Displays:** A clean grid of "Quiz Topics" (e.g., "Menopause," "Endometriosis").
      * **Action:** User clicks a topic.

2.  **Page 2: Quiz (Route: `/quiz/:topicId`)**

      * **Component:** `<Quiz />`
      * **Logic:**
          * Loads the correct quiz data from `quizData.json` based on the URL.
          * Manages state: `currentQuestionIndex`, `score`, `userAnswer`.
          * Displays `<Question />` for `quizData.topics[0].questions[0]`.
      * **Action:** User clicks an `<AnswerOption />`.

3.  **Step 2b: The Feedback (Still on Quiz Page)**

      * **Component:** `<Explanation />`
      * **Logic:**
          * When the user answers, this component appears.
          * It receives the `question` object as a prop.
          * It compares the `userAnswer` to the `correctAnswer`.
          * It displays "Correct\!" or "Incorrect."
          * It **always** displays the `question.explanation.title` and `question.explanation.text`. This is the non-negotiable educational part.
      * **Action:** User clicks "Next Question." The `Quiz` component updates its state, and the next question is shown.

4.  **Page 3: Score (Route: `/results/:topicId`)**

      * **Component:** `<ScoreScreen />`
      * **Logic:**
          * Displays the final score (e.g., "You got 7/10 correct\!").
          * **Crucially:** It should also map over *all* the questions from that topic and display a summary list of the "Facts Learned" (pulling all the `explanation` text) so the user can review them.

This layout creates an engaging quiz where the "punishment" for a wrong answer (and the reward for a right one) is the same: you learn an interesting scientific fact.

Would you like me to help draft some more sample questions and "why" explanations for another topic, like breast cancer or endometriosis?
